Installation
======================

The latest update can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/kschan0214/gacelle>`_.

You need to add the directory of the package to your Matlab's PATH

``addpath(genpath('/path/to/gacelle/'))``

It is recommended to use the latest Matlab version for the best compatibility of their Deep Learning Toolbox. We did most of the development and testings on R2023a, though in principle the package should compatibile to earlier Matlab versions back to R2019b (not tested).
